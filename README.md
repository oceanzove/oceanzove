Hi there, I'm front-developer.
My passion for software is to come up with ideas and bring them to life.  
From goals: senior, polyglot programmer.

*I actually write code to feed myself and my wife. If I didn't need money I would be traveling around the world with a guitar and my wife and know Zen.*
